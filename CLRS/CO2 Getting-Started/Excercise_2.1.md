### 2. Rewrite the INSERTION-SORT procedure to sort into nonincreasing instead of nondecreasing order.

`Answer` :

```cpp
    for j = 2 to A.length
    key = A[j]
    // Insert A[j] into the sorted sequence A[1..j âˆ’ 1]
    i = j âˆ’ 1
    while i > 0 and A[i] < key
        A[i + 1] = A[i]
        i = i âˆ’ 1
    A[i + 1] = key
```
