### 1. Using Figure 2.4 as a model, illustrate the operation of merge sort on the array A = {3, 41, 52, 26, 38, 57, 9, 49}.

### 2. Rewrite the MERGE procedure so that it does not use sentinels, instead stopping once either array L or R has had all its elements copied back to A and then copying the remainder of the other array back into A.

`Answer` :

```cpp
MERGE(A, p, q, r)

 n1 = q - p + 1
 n2 = r - q
 create arrays L[1..n1] and R[1..n2]
 for i = 1 to n1
   L[i] = A[p + i - 1]
 for j = 1 to n2
   R[j] = A[q + j]
 i = 1
 j = 1
 for k = p to r
   if i > n1
    A[k] = R[j]
    j = j + 1
   else if j > n2
    A[k] = L[i]
    i = i + 1
   else if L[i] â‰¤ R[j]
    A[k] = L[i]
    i = i + 1
   else
    A[k] = R[j]
    j = j + 1
```

### 4. We can express insertion sort as a recursive procedure as follows. In order to sort A[1...n], we recursively sort A[1...n-1] and then insert A[n] into the sorted array A[1...n-1]. Write a recurrence for the running time of this recursive version of insertion sort.
