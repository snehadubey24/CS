# Divide and Conquer Paradigm

---

## Divide :

- Divide the problem into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.

## Conquer :

- Conquer the subproblems by solving them recursively. If the subproblem sizes are small enough, however, just solve the subproblems in a straight forward manner.

## Combine :

- Combine the solutions of the subproblems into the solution for the original problem.

## Recurrence :

- A recurrence is an equation or inequality that describes a function in terms of it's value on smaller Inputs.

### Three methods for solving recurrences :

- Substitution Method
- Recursion-tree Method
- Master Method
