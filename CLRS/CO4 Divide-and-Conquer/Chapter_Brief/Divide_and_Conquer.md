# Divide and Conquer Paradigm

---

## Divide :

- Divide the problem into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.

##Conquer :

- Conquer the subproblems by solving them recursively. If the subproblem sizes are small enough, however, just solve the subproblems in a straight forward manner.
